I want the search tool to utilize semantic understanding to expand or correct my search queries, suggesting relevant alternatives or refining ambiguous terms, so that I can quickly find the products I&rsquo;m looking for even if my initial query is imprecise.</p><p>As a consumer, I want to be able to learn about previous customers&rsquo; experience with a product (via reviews), so that I can best make a decision on whether my needs will be met by purchasing a product. Therefore, I want to be able to perform Natural language querying on reviews by simply asking questions: &ldquo;Do these airpods typically fall out of the ear when sweating and working out?&rdquo; The response they get should be a breakdown of percentages by customer demographic in the reviews that answered part of this question. For example, when asked to leave a review, when mentioning that airpods do or do not fall out, the smart review system should ask followup questions like: do other brands of headphones also fall out for you, do you have small/big ears, etc&mldr;</p><p>Which leads us to the next feature:</p><p>As a busy consumer, I want the review process to be quick and easy, so that I can share my feedback without it taking up too much of my time. I don&rsquo;t want to sit down and write a paragraph from scratch, but rather the few salient observations I&rsquo;ve had on a product. I also don&rsquo;t have a good understanding of how to create observations that are beneficial to others, as some experiences may be unique to myself. With an understanding of these demographic differences, the smart review system will ask me specific questions when I bring up an observation. To continue the example above, if I mention that the airpods keep falling out during my workouts - I&rsquo;ll be asked to provide a brief description of my ear shape/size.</p><p>As a consumer, I want to see the impact of my reviews on other users&rsquo; purchasing decisions and the overall community, so that I feel motivated to continue leaving feedback. Our product provides the infrastructure to streamline the process of following up post-purchase and guiding customers through the review creation process. Customers are further incentivized to create a review to earn free semantic searches.</p><p>As a marketplace platform, I want to provide sellers with an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights extracted from customer reviews, including sentiment trends, popular topics, and sentiment distribution over time, to facilitate data-driven decision-making and strategic planning. As a marketplace seller, I want to leverage semantic analysis of customer interactions and purchases to build detailed customer profiles and segmentations, allowing for more targeted marketing campaigns and improved understanding of customer demographics and preferences.</p><p>As a marketplace platform, I want to establish a feedback loop between customer interactions, semantic analysis, and recommendation refinement, allowing for iterative improvements in the search and recommendation system based on user feedback and outcomes.</p><h2 id=the-list>The List:</h2><ol><li>Natural Language Search with Semantic Understanding:</li></ol><ul><li>Allow users to input natural language queries to search for products.</li><li>Implement semantic search powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search accuracy.</li><li>Utilize semantic understanding to expand or correct search queries, suggesting relevant alternatives or refining ambiguous terms.</li></ul><ol start=2><li>Smart Review System with Natural Language Querying:</li></ol><ul><li>Enable users to ask questions about products using natural language.</li><li>Provide responses based on breakdowns of percentages by customer demographics in reviews.</li><li>Incorporate follow-up questions in the review process to gather more specific feedback.</li></ul><ol start=3><li>Quick and Easy Review Process:</li></ol><ul><li>Simplify the review process for busy consumers by allowing them to share brief observations.</li><li>Offer tailored questions based on demographic differences to guide users in providing beneficial feedback.</li><li>Show users the impact of their reviews on other users&rsquo; purchasing decisions and the community.</li><li>Provide infrastructure to streamline post-purchase follow-up and review creation process.</li></ul><ol start=4><li>Seller Dashboard for Customer Insights:</li></ol><ul><li>Offer sellers an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights from customer reviews and user searches in conjunction.</li><li>Include sentiment trends, popular topics, and sentiment distribution over time.</li><li>Facilitate data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for sellers.</li></ul><ol start=5><li>Semantic Analysis for Customer Profiling and Targeted Marketing:</li></ol><ul><li>Leverage semantic analysis of customer interactions and purchases to build detailed customer profiles.</li><li>Enable segmentation for targeted marketing campaigns and improved understanding of customer demographics and preferences.</li></ul><ol start=6><li>Feedback Loop for Search and Recommendation System:</li></ol><ul><li>Establish a feedback loop between customer interactions, semantic analysis, and recommendation refinement.</li><li>Allow for iterative improvements in the search and recommendation system based on user feedback and outcomes.</li></ul></div></div><footer class="py-3 mt-auto bg-light"><div class="container py-1 my-1"><div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center"><p class="col-md mb-0 text-muted">Open-source <a class="text-muted text-decoration-none" href=https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme/blob/main/LICENSE>MIT</a> Licensed.</p><ul class="nav col-md-auto justify-content-end"><li class=nav-item><a href=/code-of-conduct/ class="nav-link px-2 text-muted" title='Code of Conduct' aria-label='Code of Conduct'>Code of Conduct</a></li><li class=nav-item><a href=/privacy-policy/ class="nav-link px-2 text-muted" title='Privacy Policy' aria-label='Privacy Policy'>Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/js/main.min.e8d88c82c0438b527f1aca4115652ba1e2877bf805b75593b23ac0e3fe2b3fe95a467d1feef275355132ba061da6404b0d24d55afabc209b294b1db043be014d.js integrity="sha512-6NiMgsBDi1J/GspBFWUroeKHe/gFt1WTsjrA4/4rP+laRn0f7vJ1NVEyugYdpkBLDSTVWvq8IJspSx2wQ74BTQ==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script></body></html>
